# simple quiz app

The main idea of the project is to build a quiz application for the .csv file that contains questions

l'obiettivo principale della applicazione è la flessibilità
The main objective of this application is flexibility so the essential difference is that despite other webdsites
that need to insert the questions one by one in a form, in this application you can drop a text file of whatever format to instantly make a quiz.
The only constraint is that the format of the file should be: 
<u>question number</u>; 
<u>question</u>; 
<u>option1</u>; 
<u>option2</u>; 
<u>option3</u>; 
<u>option4</u>; 
<u>copy of the correct option</u>

### various modes
after reading the questions (you can confirm that the file have been read correctly if you can see a preview of the text file)
 you can choose between open questions and question with options.
With the first option all the questions will be shown one at a time and you can try answering it without any help,
you can later see if the answer you gave was close enough for your standards by showing the correct answer with the button show answer
- if you chose that you gave the correct answer then you can press the corrisponding button and the question wont be asked you again,
- if you chose that you gave the wrong answer then you can press the corrisponding button and the question will be reproposed in the future.

With the second option all the questions will be shown on e at a time with theri relative options and they will be reproposed untill you get them all right

                                                                                                    
## requirements                                                                                 
****before everything you need to have some version of java installed on your machine****  
you can download the application from the download section.

if youre coming from the Unimi Course: Aspetti Etici Legali e sociali dell'informatica you need to have a copy of the questions
